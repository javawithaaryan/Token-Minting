# ‚è≥ Time-Locked Inheritance Vault

## üéØ Project Description
Time-Locked Inheritance Vault is a decentralized smart contract system that enables users to create secure, time-locked vaults for digital asset inheritance. The platform allows users to deposit cryptocurrency, set beneficiaries, define unlock conditions, and mint inheritance tokens that serve as proof of beneficiary rights. This solves the critical problem of digital asset transfer in case of emergencies or planned inheritance.

## üåü Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize digital estate planning by providing a trustless, transparent, and secure mechanism for cryptocurrency inheritance. We aim to bridge the gap between traditional inheritance systems and blockchain technology, ensuring that digital assets can be passed on to loved ones without relying on centralized third parties or complex legal processes.
